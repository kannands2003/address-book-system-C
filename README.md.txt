# 📒 Address Book Management System in C


## 📌 About the Project
The **Address Book Management System** is a console-based program written in **C**.  
It enables users to store and manage contact information efficiently using a simple menu-based interface.  
The system supports **adding, searching, editing, deleting, and viewing contacts**, with data stored in a CSV file for persistence.

This project was completed during my training at **Emertxe Information Technologies**, helping strengthen core C programming, file I/O, and modular coding concepts.
